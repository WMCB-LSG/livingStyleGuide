        "I stand before you to sit behind you, to tell you a story I know nothing about..." I'm the Magazine Director and Founder of Due Diligence Magazine. I code the site and keep it all in working order, fighting grey hat hackers when the mood strikes. I'm a designer, of the web, of the motion picture, the static image, of words and thoughts.

        I'm Zach I study Advertising at QUT, Josh and I founded Dd mag to help showcase the glory that is Brisbane.
        While is write this I have to fight the urge to make it sound like a dating site bio (i think it would be funny if i did it that way, but i must resist).
        
        So as you can probably tell i'm fairly easy going and enjoy a laugh here, there and everywhere.
        Enjoy this peek at my soul, hell you may meet me one day and get to fold back the preverbal curtain that shrouds my being.

        Alex is a fashion fiend who struggles to find anything else
        to discuss/think about. A majority of her time is spent
        sitting in front of her wardrobe planning outfits for the
        days to come. Fashion aside, she loves to travel and write
        about anything and everything interesting that crosses her
        path.
